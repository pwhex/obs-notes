Tried with E2
Tried with HeNe to Debug the VI
Tried with PL202 (Pocket Laser) to find the TDZ by coherence length
Looked like the point is a bit below the zero point of the conex
Changed the top chopper holder to the screw below.
Tried again with PL202 - gave a similar kind of decaying behavior
Tried with E2 with a narrow BW
Voila!
