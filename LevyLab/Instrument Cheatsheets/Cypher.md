HW Steps:
1.  Take the stage out partially
2.  Remove the tip holder from the cypher (small screw driver)
3.  Mount the tip holder to the custom mount to insert the tip
4.  Select the preferred tip -> Record it on the tip log sheet
5.  Insert the tip into the tip holder
6.  Insert the package in to the Cypher stage and fix the stage

SW Steps:
1.  Find the Tip
2.  Align the focus -> Zero PD
	Sum - 10 (or Max) / Deflection - 0
3.  Calibrate the Tip
	1.  Set Parameters (Tune/Imaging)
		1.  800 mV with -5%, Set point (AC) - 600 mV
	2.  Auto tune - High Q/Low Drive
4.  Check the Focus on tip + Focus on Sample
5.  Pre-engage
6.  Zero PD + Auto tune
7.  Tip Approach
8.  If everything looks good -> Scan

	Amplitude and Phase (only in AC mode)

	Focus (Objective control)
	Tip (Tip control)

```ad-note
Auto tune:
The idea of tuning is the thermal frequency should be tuned to the resonant frequency of the tip so that it can control the tip accurately. We need a low decay (High Q) and a low amplitude (Low drive).
