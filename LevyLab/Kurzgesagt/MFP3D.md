Make sure:
- The DAQ connections are correct
- Camera light is ON
- The lights are off

Tip loading:
- Move the sample stage left so that the tip won't interfere with the wire bonds when loaded
- Raise the stage into a healthy position (left is up)
- Remove the module
- Mount the sample in the sample holder
- Remove the tip holder
- Change the tip, attach the holder and secure the module onto the 3 magnetic groves.

Adjust the camera/laser position:
- Adjust the camera so that you can see the tip on the screen (back knob)
- Adjust the laser position so that the correct beam is aligned on top of the tip such that the Sum signal is maximum (LDX/LDY)
- Once the Sum signal is maxed, adjust the Quad photo diode such that the deflection is zeroed. (PD+/-)
- Now tune the tip using "Auto-tune". Make sure the parameters are: 800mv/-5%

Find the canvas:
- While looking at the tip, move the module Z down to a safer position
- Adjust the camera focus such that it's focused on the sample.
- Move the sample stage to find the canvas
- Go left and up
- (Do another auto-tune if you prefer)
- Engage the tip and go down till Z voltage is around 80
- Find the canvas
- Do a test scan and center the scan
- Turn off the camera lights
