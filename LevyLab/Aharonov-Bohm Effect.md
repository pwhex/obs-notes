Magnetic field lines are used to describe how a magnet behaves in a magnetic field.

From Maxwell's equations we know that:

$$  
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} &= 0 \\  
\nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}
\end{split}\end{equation}  
$$

Magnetic fields can get really tedious. Hence, we define another quantity to make things convenient. 
We know that the divergence of a curl is always zero.
So using the equation above, we can write:
$$  
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} &= 0 \\  
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{A}) &= 0 \\
\implies \vec{B} &= (\nabla \times \vec{A})
\end{split}\end{equation}  
$$
$\vec{A}$ is known as the Magnetic vector potential. Sometimes working with this quantity is easier than working with the magnetic field.

However, if we want to find $\vec{A}$ given $\vec{B}$, it has many possible solutions. But it's not the other way round. In short: $\vec{A} \rightarrow \vec{B}$ has only one possible solution and $\vec{B} \rightarrow \vec{A}$ has multiple possible solutions.

Field is the real thing. Potential is a mathematical construct for convenience. 

Quantum systems are associated with wavefuncitons.
What happens when an electron passes near a solenoid?

Theoretically, it's possible to find a region where the field is zero but the potential is not. In such a region, the phase of the wavefunction of the electron will change.
